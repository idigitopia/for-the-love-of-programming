# Dependent Noise Model

### Maximum Likelihood  Under a Dependent Noise Model 

Let X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>1</sub>, ..., X<sub>1</sub> be noisy measurements of some true value &theta;, such that: \
X<sub>i</sub> = &theta; + e<sub>i</sub> \
where we assume the per measurement noise term Xesub>1</sub> as \
e<sub>i</sub> = &alpha; e<sub>i-1</sub> + &epsilon;<sub>i</sub>, \
with &epsilon;<sub>i</sub>, distributed according to a standard normal and &alpha; as a known constant.
